	<h1>Wii Emulation Hosting Site</h1>
	<p>This site hosts the files for most if not all of the emulators for the Nintendo Wii and how to install them on your wii!</p>
	<h2>PLEASE READ ME</h2>
	<p>The emulators require that you first "jailbreak" your wii. I will include instructions to do this below. The emulators the wii is capable of playing is vast and alot of them have a good level of compatibility! There will be a chart with all the systems and links/files to download included and a search bar to quickly get to which system you wish to emulate on the wii. Some emulators may require additional work to make function. We will also explain how to install wiiware/virtual console games.</p>

<p>Now obviously the image is a joke but the idea is similar to modding a wii, only not doing anything to it hardware wise.</p>
<h3>What you will need</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Computer with a sd card reader</li>
        <li>A Nintendo Wii(Only the original wii will work)</li>

	<h3>How to jailbreak your wii!</h3>
	<ol>
	
	<li>Find out what your Wii's MAC Address is. You do this by going to the <strong>"Wii Settings"</strong> then by selecting the <strong>"Internet"</strong> option and finally going to <strong>"Console Information"</strong>.</li>

    <li>Make sure to put your SD card into your computer and formating it into <strong>FAT32</strong>. You can do this by going to <strong>Disk Management</strong> on your computer while the SD card is inserted and then right clicking it and pressing format. Then select FAT32 and then click OK.  </li>

	<li>Leave this open and go to the HackMii website to get the entryway to modding on the wii, the <strong><a href="https://please.hackmii.com/">Letterbomb</a></strong></li> and choose your System Menu version and then type in your MAC address. The buttons "Cut the red wire" and "Cut the blue wire" do the same thing, downloads the letterbomb and then <strong>EXTRACT</strong> the Letterbomb onto the SD card. <strong>DO NOT</strong> just drag the file into the SD.

    <li>Turn on your wii and click on the messages icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and you will see your letterbomb. Go ahead and open the letter up and a screen will pop-up asking you to continue to download HackMii. Make sure to install the <strong>Homebrew Channel</strong> which is for getting emulators and roms on the system and <strong>Bootmii</strong> for back-ups incase your system bricks.</li>
